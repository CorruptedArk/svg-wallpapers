# svg-wallpapers
A collection of scalable vector wallpaper files that I made for myself and thought would be cool to share

pop_background.svg uses [distributor-logo-pop-os.svg](https://github.com/pop-os/icon-theme/blob/6bf93473f4364651b298ea0ca12d44f2cf7c3325/src/bitmaps/logos/distributor-logo-pop-os.svg) from Pop!_OS by System76 as an asset. My work is not endorsed by System76 or any other contributors to Pop!_OS.
